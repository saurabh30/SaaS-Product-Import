# SaaS-Product-Import
Command line script to import products from different sources.

### Summary
* Installation : You need to install .Net Core 2.2 to run this app.
* Run Code/Test : Easier way is to use Visual Studio(I used VS2017),open the .sln file and use default launch setings. Alternatively you can use .exe generated.
* If I had more time 
  * I would make it working by implementing the parsers.
  * I would write more unit test cases and add some functionl tests.
  * I would like to do some pair-programming and have some code-reviews.
